# Barcode Scanner System with Student Login UI

This project implements a registration and login system based on barcode scanning, featuring a student-focused user interface. It can be adapted for use in colleges, schools, or any organization utilizing barcodes for identification.

## Features

*   **Registration:** Users can register by scanning their barcode and entering their name. 
*   **Login:**  Registered users can log in by scanning their barcode and entering their name.
*   **Student Login UI:** After successful login, a new window opens with a student-oriented interface, including:
    *   Options bar for navigation
    *   Header with welcome message
    *   Content area for displaying information
    *   Footer with copyright and contact details

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** Programming language for the core logic.
*   **Tkinter:** GUI toolkit for creating the user interface.
*   **OpenCV and Pyzbar:** Libraries for barcode scanning and decoding. 
*   **Pillow (PIL Fork):** Image processing library for handling the background image and blur effect.

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  **Install Required Libraries:** Use pip to install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python pyzbar Pilow
    ```
3.  **Project Files:**
    *   **`main.py`:**  This is the main file that runs the application.
    *   **`app_window.py`:** Contains the code for creating the student login window UI. 

## Running the Application

1.  **Run `main.py`:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2.  **Register or Login:**  The main window will display options to register or log in. Follow the on-screen instructions to scan your barcode and enter your name.
3.  **Student Login Window:** Upon successful login, the main window will close, and the student login window will open. 

## Customization

*   **UI Styling:**  You can customize the colors, fonts, and layout of the UI in the code to match your preferences. 
*   **Content:** Implement the content loading functions and add the specific content for each section of the student login window. 
*   **Features:**  Extend the functionality by adding more features to the student login system, such as course information, grades, or attendance tracking. 

## Additional Notes

*   **Image Files:** Make sure you have the necessary image files (e.g., logo, icons) in the project directory. 
*   **Camera Access:** Ensure your camera is accessible to the application for barcode scanning. 
*   **Error Handling:**  Consider adding more robust error handling to handle potential exceptions during barcode decoding or other operations. 

## Future Enhancements

*   **Database Integration:** Store user data and barcode information in a database for persistence.
*   **User Authentication:** Implement more secure user authentication methods.
*   **Advanced UI Toolkit:** Explore using a more advanced UI toolkit like PyQt or Kivy for a richer user experience.
